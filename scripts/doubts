1) From where do we get the incidence matrix?
   All vertex matrix elements are initialized with angles of edges at vertex in initialization step, But do we know the map earlier ..as in these angles?

2) How to decide number of updates?

3) How do updates occur simultaneously for all robots

4) Algorithm 4 -- how to find shortest path?
